# Pythonpan

Pythonpan is an _exploratory_ project to study the viability of porting or mirroring core functionality of [Pattypan](https://github.com/yarl/pattypan) using Python.

It was started in [Wikimedia Hackathon 2023](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Hackathon_2023).

## Current big limitations:

* Only tested in Ubuntu. 
* Only a command-line tool.
* Only working for the "Photograph" template
* Only working for users that are uploading photos that they took themselves.
* Only prompting user for a limited number of fields

## Workflow

After cloning the repository to your machine, run `python3 generate_metadata.py` to run the code equivalent to pattypan's "Generate Spreadsheet". 


The command line will prompt you to fill some categories. Default titles, categories and descriptions can be pre-set in the "./config.yaml" file.

The code will create a "metadata.csv" file in the target folder with the very same fields generated by pattypan.

You can edit and re-save the metadata csv as needed, but the generated `metadata.csv` file should work finely.

To upload the files, simulating the "Validate & Upload" button (but without validations), you can run `python3 run_upload.py` to start the uploads to commons. It will ask you for the folder with metadata.csv, your username and your password.
